# Git Guide

This is basically a reference guide for the lab today. You're joining a tradition set forth by the founders of GUMAD many years ago: signing the `README.md`!

## Prereqs

### Git!

It's helpful if you have git installed.

#### üçé Mac Installation

##### Step 1: Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for mac. You'll need it for a bunch of stuff.

Install by copy/pasting the following into your terminal:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

##### Step 2: Install git

Once you have brew, you can type the following in your terminal to install git:

```
brew install git
```

Woo you have git.

#### üêß Linux Installation

If you're on Ubuntu or any other debian based system, just run the following in your terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

If you're not on Debian based systems, you get to figure this one out yourself.

#### üò≠ Windows Installation

If you're on windows, install it by following [the steps here.](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

You'll get a terminal as part of the installation, that will be what we mean by "terminal" for you during this process.

### A reasonable OS (kinda)

FYI: like most things, this guide is easier in linux or mac. It's still very possible, but you may run into some annoyances. If you haven't switched yet, this might serve as a good wakeup call to give using a unix-based operating system (Mac or Linux) a try.

If you're a windows user trying to switch to mac, try [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)! It's modern, friendly version of linux that runs everything you need. Many of us used it as our main OS for a long while.

It's much, much nicer than the lubuntu linux VM that they had you try in your CS 121 or Operating Systems classes.

If you're on windows and really, really don't want to switch, you can still complete this lab. It's cool. We won't judge that much.

### The command line

If you can open your terminal and know what `cd` and `ls` do, then you're good. No fancy wizardry here, we'll explain any other commands used.

### A text editor

You'll need some way to edit raw text files. (IE: Not microsoft word). [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) are popular free choices.
